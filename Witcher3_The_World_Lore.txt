The story of The Witcher takes place on the Continent, a land inhabited by elves, dwarves, gnomes and humans.
The humans are the dominant race on the continent, divided between the powerful Nilfgaard Empire in the South and the various Northern kingdoms in the...North. 
The relationship between Nilfgaard and the Northern kingdoms is rocky at best, with numerous wars waged between the two factions in Nilfgaard’s attempt to conquer the North of the continent.
The third war between the two took place during the events of The Witcher 2, with the Nilfgaardian Emperor using the witchers of the Viper school to destabilize the North before Nilfgaard’s invasion (more on the that later). 
The outcome of the third invasion is still unclear, and light will be shed on it in The Witcher 3.
Aside from the aforementioned races, the Continent is home to many vicious monsters that prey on the Continent’s citizens. 
The monsters didn’t always exist on the Continent, but came with an ancient cataclysmic event known as the Conjunction of Spheres. 
The conjunction is a clash between the many ‘worlds’ that existed in this world, and monsters from different worlds and dimensions were trapped in the continent during the conjunction. 
These unnatural monsters spread fear all across the continents, and thus the citizens had to find someone to battle these monsters. 
This is where The Witchers come in.
