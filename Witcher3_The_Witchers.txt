To put it simply The Witchers are the monster hunters, a necessity that arose due to plethora of monsters that came with the Conjunction.
Chosen at a young age for their aptitude, they undergo extremely rigorous training, exposure to alchemical potions and mutagens, and finally, they graduate with a process called Trial of Grasses, a process that not many survive, but those who survive it are gifted with inhuman speed, accelerated healing, and enhanced combat abilities and reflexes, and are rendered immune to diseases.
There are four schools - The Wolf, The Cat, The Griffin and the Viper (introduced in The Witcher 2), and the differences between the schools is largely in where they are located.
The Wolf is the school that Geralt belongs to.
Not much is known about the Cat and Griffin schools, as they as are mentioned sparingly in Witcher works.
The Viper school plays a big part in The Witcher 2 as it is located in the Nilfgaard Empire before it fell into ruins years ago (reason was never explicitly mentioned).
Its remaining members formed the Kingslayers, assassins who work for the Emperor of Nilfgaard to assassinate Northern kings and destabilize their kingdoms, and in return they were promised that the Nilfgaardian Emperor would rebuild their school in Nilfgaard.
Due to their mutant nature, The Witchers are simultaneously hated and feared by the populace, viewing them as greedy sellswords at best, and unnatural freaks at worst.
This culminated in an assault on the Witcher's keep of Kaer Morhen, where an angry mob stormed the fortress and massacred the Witchers.
Few Witchers survived the assault, but they lost the means to create and train new Witchers, thus beginning the slow extinction of the Witcher profession.
